# Cyclistic-Bike-Share-Project
Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

 
This analysis is from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera. I chose to do the Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis Case Study as my Capstone Project.
Scenario:
For the purposes of this project, I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. My team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. Using these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. 
Background:
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. 
Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, they want to focus on  converting casual riders into members. 
Business Task:
Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. Discover how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. 
Business Objectives:
Three questions will guide the future marketing program: 

1.	How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? 
2.	Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? 
3.	How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
